# ELEKTRONIKA-1 - A replacement module for the Russian vintage LED watch Elektronika 1 anno 1978 

## It actually works
So I think the PCB and firmware is in a good place right.

The watch works very well and I am pretty happy with it.

Battery life is calculated to be around 10 years (much less if you actually press any buttons)

The led technology from the late 1970 uses a lot of current.

The watch uses around 0.002 mA/h in standby and 10-40 mA/h depending on intensity, while displaying.
