# ELEKTRONIKA-1 - A replacement module for the Russian vintage LED watch Elektronika 1 anno 1978 

## It actually works
The watch works very well and I am pretty happy with it.

It has been my daily driver for a few months by now with no problems what so ever.

I'm actually very proud of the project as a whole.

Battery life is calculated to be around 10 years (less if you actually press buttons as the LED technology from the late 1970 uses a lot of current).

The watch uses around 0.002 mA/h in standby and 10-40 mA/h depending on display intensity.
